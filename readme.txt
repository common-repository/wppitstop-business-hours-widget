Een widget die content wisselt op basis van een begin- en eindtijd.

The WPPitstop.nl Business Hours Widget Plugin adds the possibility to include HTML-elements or plain text to your website's widget areas that appear between certain times, or switch between content.

Think, for example, of a chat button that only appears during business hours, or an office phone number during the day and an emergency mobile number in the evening. You could even just have fun and display a sun and a moon ;-)
